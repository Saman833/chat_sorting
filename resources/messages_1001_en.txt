How many CTOs does it take to figure out double taxation...

I seem to have figured out most of the questions, but when I read what's written here, it becomes scary :) You’ve mixed everything together — double taxation, citizenship, CFC, automatic exchange, notifications to the tax authorities, and fines.
These are all parallel processes.

You could also add that in Russia, you can now choose when to be considered a tax resident — after 90 or 182 days.

My colleague was just tricked. EPAM did that for a while. Just to make it hard for him to change jobs because with a blue card, you can just stand up and leave. And nothing in the legal field will stop you. After 18 months of work, you don’t even need permission; you just go and start at a new job. Permission, if needed, takes a couple of weeks even before 18 months, just to renew the decision. I did that. They don’t even change the card, by the way, just some fuss and a couple of hundred zlotys from the company.

When I changed jobs, I consulted, and they told me there was a two-week window before and after the job change. You just fill out a form, provide a new contract, and a statement from the previous job — that’s it, no need to reissue the card, it's just a notification process.

Isn’t EPAM a body shop? I got calls from other companies saying, “We’ll relocate you to the US, visa ‘O’, transfer to a branch (you can’t change employers), a 3-year contract, then we’ll get you a green card.” I asked, “What if I want to leave after a year? Will I have to repay any debts?”

They said, “Don’t worry, no one does that, everyone keeps rowing :) But it’s all written in the contract, you’ll find out on-site, we don’t hide anything, you’ll get to review it.”

So how much would I owe?

I can’t say for sure, around $20,000, that’s the company’s expense.

message-66182: user172556084 2020-08-17 12:46:11
So they’re offering you $5-7K, with taxes and housing. You’ll be left with next to nothing. And that’s for the prospect of a green card :) If you leave, you’ll be in debt.

Yeah, Luxoft, EPAM — the scheme is the same. Transfer on an L visa, then some indefinite period of work before submitting the application, a lot of running around and trying to get something as a powerless rower, and then either you get tired, or you get lucky, or they finally do it.

message-66186: user167397453 2020-08-17 12:49:38
In fact, you can apply for a green card from the first day of work, officially. They make up stories like, “You need to work a year first, then the process takes another two, and then maybe we’ll do it.” The worst part is that the transfer from L to a green card is only possible at the company’s request, you can’t initiate it yourself.

Here’s an example: A prenuptial agreement can be declared invalid if it infringes on the rights of one of the parties. After 15 years, a split, 2 apartments (which were owned before the marriage and resold), and the second half gets nothing. The court: The rights were infringed because one party could have had an apartment, so the court says, OK, and that’s it :) 

That’s why prenups are pointless, no point in signing them. The legal practice is such, and there are plenty of other similar examples.

Well, I’m not trying to start a flame war. I’m just saying it’s annoying. In Spain, by the way, this doesn’t happen, even though they’re neighbors. Everything is probably thriving there too, but you have to look for it yourself. And nobody clings to you 🙂

Portugal is a small and poor country by European standards. Considerably poorer than even Spain. And they had a very bad drug situation. They fought it the American way, by banning and crushing, and SURPRISE — it didn’t help. Then some people realized that “this is not a coincidence,” and they changed the policy to a more tolerant one. And it turned out to be very effective. But the journey isn’t over, so you’ll still find remnants.

And I’ve also heard a lot of stories about European cities where “African pushers” block the way. And just as many stories from those same cities from people who didn’t encounter anything like that. Maybe you just had bad luck with the time or place and projected that experience onto the whole country.

Well, I drove through half of Spain and Portugal with stops in major cities, so the sample is quite representative. It wasn’t just a case of walking around during a layover for an hour. And again, I don’t really fit the Mediterranean type; in Scandinavia, I’m always taken for a local and they try all the regional languages before switching to English :). And we’ve already figured out that Portugal hasn’t delivered anything special yet, so there’s no interest. Sorry if I touched on some flame war topic, I didn’t mean to 🙂

My wife and I considered Portugal as one of the main options last year. In two weeks of living in Porto, drugs were only offered in a designated night club district. But the weather was nasty most of the time, maybe everyone was hiding.

Guys, what do you think about ready-made packages from codecanyon for Laravel? In terms of their usability.

For example, there's a system that solves all my current tasks for developing a SaaS. 

message-66287: user105728004 2020-08-17 23:13:23

It already has a role system, payment integration, accounts on different subdomains, REST API, authorization, etc. So it’s a kind of foundation that is present in every project anyway.

My developers couldn’t even release half of what’s in there, starting everything from scratch. In the iteration, tariffs, roles, and more were also being created... They released basically nothing, or slightly less than nothing.

So the question arises, is there any point in building this from scratch if there are already ready-made solutions? Users remain users, and tariffs remain tariffs.

Another team of new developers is furiously proving that ready-made solutions are bad and everything needs to be done with the "right architecture." Of course, from scratch.

I’ve already had three such development teams, all working on the same project. Each new developer criticizes the previous one’s code. In the end, it all comes down to having to build everything from scratch again. I’m fed up.

That’s true almost always :) in development, just like in renovation, the budget is x2+, and the timeline is x3+.

That is, you’ll end up overshooting no matter what, but there’s a chance the estimates will be accurate and you’ll overshoot a little less than you could have.

You can try to think ahead a bit, and it’ll be easier later. But whether you made the right decision or not, you’ll never know because whichever path you choose, it’ll always be slower and more expensive than you’d like.

It’s an absolutely normal trend — increasing abstraction in work. Nocode is progressing by leaps and bounds, new tools are appearing.
It’s what happens in any field — it used to be normal to draw on the floor, not in AutoCAD. There are still many old-timers saying, “your programs... I’ll draw it by hand in 15 minutes.” People cling to what they know and are afraid of losing control or stepping out of their comfort zone.

How many man-hours were spent in 8 months?

I once came to an old Laravel project, and the guys had learned quite well) two order tables, and lots of other cool solutions.
I was brought in to rewrite everything (it was their decision).
In 10 months I rewrote everything, and it went into production.
But there were only one and a half people on the backend (another backender was part-time).
And it was done from scratch: app + admin panel + API for mobile, with plenty of integrations (payments, SMS, Google API, and much more).

I may be exaggerating, but Stripe integration should take a mid-level dev about a week (including tests).
We had a cool case in one app where one group of clients paid, and we gave another group of clients the money, so there was an intermediate account in Stripe for accumulating funds and for paying out to the contractors.
